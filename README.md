# FlushedOut Robot
Flushed, or FlushedOut (or FlushedOut Robot), is the new multi-purpose bot maintained by Winter78#8711 and Neritox#4417!

## About
This bot is created as a multi-purpose bot with the target for being fun and easy to use.
It also focuses on bringing an easier for your life experience when looking at the commands (we use embeds for example).

## Invite
If you want to invite the bot, here's the link!
[Invite Flushed 1](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=882057940834582588&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

If you want to invite our testing bot (which only I, Winter78, can do)
[Invite Flushed 2](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=882126923520696320&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
> To note, you will not be able to invite Flushed 2 because it is our testing bot. We will give you news about when our Flushed 2 bot goes public in our [community server](https://dsc.gg/refreshed).

## Developers
Winter78#8711 (me) and Neritox#4417 are the creators of the bot as shown in the "flu!botinfo" command.

## Release?
We'll release it when we're finished, it sounds disappointing but when we finish it, it will be **AWESOME**!
However, you can invite the bots right now if you'd like! It's not finished so don't rely on it.

## If we can't rely on it, what bots should we use?
Since we don't support many features yet and have many bug fixes planned, we recommend using alternatives such as:
* Wick Bot (for good, blasting moderation and logging included)
* Dyno (for custom commands, reaction roles and styling)
* Carl-bot (for moderation and more specific logging)
* Logger Bot (very specific logging)
* Ticket Tool (ticketing)

Those 5 bots are good for verification, ticketing, moderation (in general) and logging.
Thanks for reading!
