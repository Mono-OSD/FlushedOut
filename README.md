# Stable Info
Some info, these are files from the stable repl on https://repl.it/. This was also written in discord.py, before its demise.

All the code is in the MrBearScoobyDoo folder.

What I suggest is:
* Learn the code and skim through it
* Don't copy the code

You can also take the idea into your hands, just give me credit afterwards.

Thank you!
